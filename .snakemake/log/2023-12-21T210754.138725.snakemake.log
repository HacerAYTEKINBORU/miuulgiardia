Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

MissingOutputException in rule tRNAscan_stats in file /Users/hacer/PycharmProjects/miuulgiardia/Snakefile.smk, line 11:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/G_intestinalis.tRNA
Removing output files of failed job tRNAscan_stats since they might be corrupted:
output/G_intestinalis.stats
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
